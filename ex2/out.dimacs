c Recall each line starting with c encodes a graph in DIMACS format!
c The first non-comment line specifies the number of nodes and edges:
p edge 4 2
c Each of the remaining non-comment lines specifies a weighted edge by two nodes:
e 1 4 -889
e 2 3 -301
c If you use this graph class in your solution, you should probably remove this comments!
