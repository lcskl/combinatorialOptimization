blossom5-v2.05.src:
  The version of the blossom library you should use.
  Note the licence does not allow you to use it for commercial applications!
  If you want to use a different matching library, please ask me first.
  NOTE: blossomV will SEGFAULT if no perfect matching exists (at least I was told so)!

instances, generate_random_Kn.tcl generate_instances.sh:
  The instances folder (which I will upload separately) contains some instances generated by these two scripts.
  If you want to generate more/new instances, you may need to install tcl.
  I will generate new instances for testing, so don't overtune to these instances!

src:
  Currently contains example code for finding a minimum weight perfect matching.

.compile.sh, clean.sh:
  simple bash scripts for compiling and cleaning.
Call ./compile.sh debug or ./compile.sh opt to build with or without debugging symbols, respectively.


RUN: 
     ./bin/minimum-mean-cycle <dimacs-file>
  Example:
     ./bin/minimum-mean-cycle ./instances/K1024.dimacs
