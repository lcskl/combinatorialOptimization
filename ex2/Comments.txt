    utils.hpp / utils.cpp:
        Functions that do not directly relate to either the T-join or the Minimum Mean Weight Cycle algo

        - dfs: given a visited array, it stamps every reachable vertex with a given value using a depth first search

    join.hpp / join.cpp:
        Methods for calculating the minimum weight empty join

        - minimum_weight_empty_join: implementing the minimum weight T-join for T = empty
        - connected_components: Given a subset of vertices T, it returns a list of 'Graph' objects with the connected components of G(T) (graph spanned by those vertices).

        Added:
        - odd_v_minus: returns list of vertices with odd degree w.r.t negative edges.
